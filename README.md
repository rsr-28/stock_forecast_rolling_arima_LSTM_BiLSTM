📊 Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA and LSTM
Forecasting future values from historical time series data is essential in domains like finance, economics, and strategic planning. Traditional models such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) have been widely used for their strength in modeling linear and stationary time series. However, they struggle with capturing non-linear patterns, volatility, and long-term dependencies.

Modern deep learning techniques — particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks — address these challenges by retaining information over longer sequences through specialized memory gates. This makes LSTM well-suited for dynamic and complex forecasting tasks that require modeling temporal dependencies and non-linearities.

🧪 Project Overview
This project compares the performance of ARIMA and LSTM models across nine diverse time series datasets, including:

5 Stock Market Indices

Nikkei 225 (N225)

NASDAQ Composite (IXIC)

Hang Seng Index (HSI)

S&P 500 (GSPC)

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)

4 U.S. Macroeconomic Indicators

Medical Care Index (MC)

Housing Index (HO)

Trade-Weighted U.S. Dollar Index (EX)

Money Stock (M1) Index (MS)

For stock market datasets, only the 'Close' price column was used as the predictive feature. Each time series was split into training and testing sets (70%/30%), and a rolling forecasting algorithm was implemented to make one-step-ahead predictions, retraining the model after each new observation. This approach yields more accurate and responsive forecasts than static ARIMA or standard LSTM models.

🔍 Key Results
Overall accuracy improvement: 70–75% using LSTM over ARIMA.

Stock indices: Highly volatile, showed ~86% improvement.

Macroeconomic indices: More stable, showed ~50% improvement — suggesting ARIMA may still be effective in such cases.

Additional layers (BiLSTM, CNN, Dropout) provided only marginal gains, confirming that the rolling LSTM alone captures most of the benefit.

🚀 Future Extensions
Interactive Prediction Interface
Enable users to dynamically select:

The number of lagged observations (look-back window)

The forecast horizon (how many steps ahead to predict)

Multi-Feature Learning with CNN
Extend the model to incorporate multiple features from stock data, such as:

Open, High, Low, Close, Volume

Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract spatial and temporal dependencies across all columns for more accurate predictions.

📌 Conclusion
Rolling LSTM forecasting significantly outperforms ARIMA for volatile time series data. Simpler is often better — further architectural complexity yields limited additional benefit. For stable, linear trends, traditional models still remain a strong choice.
